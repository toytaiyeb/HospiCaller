        <h1>Hospicaller</h1>
        <p>Hospicaller is a platform 
            that helps people in times of emergency
             by connecting them with nearby hospitals.
              It's a one-stop solution for all emergency
               medical needs. With a user-friendly interface,
                the app allows users to quickly and easily find
                 nearby hospitals and call them directly from the app
                 . By providing the hospital's contact information, 
                 location, and the ability to call them directly, this app
                  eliminates the stress and confusion of trying to find
                   help in an emergency situation. Whether it's a life-threatening condition or a simple injury, the app aims 
                   to provide users with the necessary information and 
                   resources to ensure they receive the proper medical attention.</p>
